# Barati.dev

A personal portfolio and resume site for Bharathiraja Muthurajan, Data Platform and AI Engineer. Built with Jekyll, featuring project showcases, a downloadable resume, and automated PDF generation.

## Features

- **Personal Portfolio**: Landing page with profile, experience, education, and contact links.
- **Project Showcases**: Projects are managed as a Jekyll collection in `_projects/` for clean URLs and easy management.
- **Resume**: 
  - Viewable as a web page (`resume.html`).
  - Downloadable as a PDF (`assets/BM_resume.pdf`), auto-generated from Markdown.
- **Automated PDF Generation**: 
  - Uses Jekyll to build the site and WeasyPrint to generate a PDF from the Markdown resume.
  - Managed via GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-barati-dev.yml`).
